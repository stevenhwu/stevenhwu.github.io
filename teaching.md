## Introduction to Bioinformatics - Agron5050

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/phylogeny.jpg" align="right" hspace="50" width="40%">

Bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving field, and it is actively used in multiple areas of researches. This interdisciplinary field integrates biology, statistics, and computer science to analyse and interpret biological data. The course covers the most fundamental concepts, methods, and tools used in bioinformatics. Students will be able to use these bioinformatics tools to solve the problems for their own researches.

**Modules in this course**
- Basic bioinformatics skills: basic statistics and programming.
- Molecular evolution: Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.
- Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis: Genome assembly, genome annotation, and metagenomics.
- Other topics in bioinformatics: image analysis, cloud computing, academic vs industry, ... etc

## Computational Skills for Biological Data Analysis  - Agron 5106
In the era of big data, proficiency in several fundamental computational skills is required to conduct high-quality analysis and reproducible research in multiple disciplines. Within the field of biology and agriculture, large-scale datasets are easily accessible due to the advancement in technology. The amount of data will continue to increase at a dramatic rate over the following decades. Students will be required to have the ability to process and analyse large amounts of data efficiently in the “-omic” and even "post-omic" era.

This course will introduce a few fundamental and transferable computational skills for students who work with biological data. These skills include but are not limited to command line interface, working with computer servers, software version control (Git and GitHub) for collaboration, software testing for reproducible analysis, working with the relational database (MySQL), data cleaning and manipulation.

Although many of these skill sets are transferable to fields outside of biology, this course will focus on their application to biological data.
