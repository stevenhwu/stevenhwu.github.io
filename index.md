Steven Wu is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Agronomy](http://www.agron.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). My primary research interests are developing statistical and computational models to address challenges in evolution and agriculture using large datasets.

Primary research topics;
- Plant and soil microbiome interaction
- Statistical methods for applied agriculture and field trial.
- Computational method for evolutionary biology with NGS data.
- Image analysis for plants.
- Open source software.
