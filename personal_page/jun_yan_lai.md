## Jun-Yan Lai

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/Jun_Yan_Lai.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="25%">
I am Lai Jun Yan, a student majoring in Agronomy at National Taiwan University. I have a profound interest in the growth, development, and improvement of plants, which is one of the reasons I chose to study Agronomy.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing table tennis. This sport not only helps me relax but also enhances my reflexes and concentration.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in learning programming. Although I am not very proficient with computers, I am eager to learn. I often seek assistance from senior students to address my programming queries, and I am eager to supplement my current skill set in the laboratory environment.

Furthermore, I am aware of my shortcomings in English communication and expression. Hence, I am keen on practicing speaking English with teachers to improve my communication and language skills.

I believe that the learning environment in the laboratory will provide me with ample opportunities for growth and improvement. I am committed to continually advancing and preparing myself for future academic and professional endeavors. Thank you for your attention and support.
