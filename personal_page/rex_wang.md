## Rex Wang

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/rex_wang.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="25%">
Rex is currently a first-year master's student in the Division of Biometry. He graduated from National Chengchi University with a degree in Statistics. Right now, he's mainly working on projects related to pest control and pest prediction. During his first semester of grad school, his main focus has been sharpening his programming skills and trying his best to pick up more biology knowledge, which he feels he's a bit lacking in. Outside of research, Rex enjoys playing tennis and swimming in his free time. Back when he was at Chengchi University, he was vice captain of the tennis team and helped lead the team to fifth place at the National Collegiate Championships three times.

#### Research Project
I am currently investigating how to develop an effective predictive method for forecasting aphid populations in soybean crops, with the aim of further improving current pest management practices. However, I am still conducting preliminary analyses at this stage, and the specific research direction will likely be determined in the coming months.

#### Previous Project
**Assisting Hour Loop in Establishing Standards for 3PL Site Selection**

This project primarily focused on developing an algorithm that, under cost minimization constraints, incorporates both distance and shipping costs to help Hour Loop better select the locations for 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) facilities.

**Assisting DJB Company in Analyzing Customer-Related Data**

This project involved conducting multivariate analysis on DJB's customer data to segment customers into different groups and propose corresponding marketing strategies tailored to customers with different characteristics.

#### Skills and qualifications

Programming language:
- R (main language), Python (somewhat rusty)
