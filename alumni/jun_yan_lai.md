During the second semester of my junior year, I joined Steven’s lab, hoping to practice my English while advancing in the field of biostatistics. Through this experience, I gained insight into how a research lab operates, learned about senior students’ projects, and understood the effort required to become a graduate student as well as my own areas for improvement.

In my senior year, Steven supervised my two seminar. Through continuous presentations and discussions, I gradually became more proficient in reading scientific papers and effectively delivering presentations. Over the one and a half years under Steven’s guidance, besides academic knowledge, what I learned most was life philosophy. Steven always approaches everything with optimism. He led us in decorating the lab for Halloween and even hosted the Christmas party. His positive attitude and the daily interactions with lab members have been my greatest gain from the lab experience.
