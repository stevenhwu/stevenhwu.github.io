Shuai Yuan is currently pursuing a master's degree in the MS Biostatistics Program at the Gillings School of Global Public Health, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. With a fervent interest in biometry and data analysis, I am actively engaged in mastering advanced statistical theory and enhancing proficiency in utilizing data analysis tools such as SAS and Python. During my tenure in Steven's lab, I wholeheartedly committed myself to developing an agent-based model aimed at simulating soil microbial systems. This endeavor holds the potential to significantly contribute to the enhancement of plant growth and the management of biofertilizers.
