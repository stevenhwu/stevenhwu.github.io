# Lab website
## Welcome to GitHub Pages
- GitHub page basic. https://pages.github.com/
- [Test and preview locally](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). This does require you to install Jekyll and a few other prerequisites.
  - Run `bundle install`.
  - Run your Jekyll site locally 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
````

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenhwu/stevenhwu.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
